# E6 raving decypher

This program is a simplified version of Pippin's raving redactionist.
The intention was to have the translation of the different glyphs appear when clicked,
but I haven't managed to do it.
Instead the clicked glyphs are highlighted and then the highlight disappears.
Aesthetics look ancient Egyptian.
