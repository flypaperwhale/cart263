# Haiku Generator ++

This program is built off of Pippin's Haiku Generator.

It should prompt the user for 1 word, which should flavor the generated poem.

The poems should have a gothic feel.

I will try to make the esthetics gothic too (reds, purples, blacks, oranges). Maybe have an image of the user's prompt.
