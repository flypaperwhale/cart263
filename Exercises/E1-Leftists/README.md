# Pick Out the Leftists (a silly game)

This is a very simple game based off of the Where is Sausage Dog activity from class. Not much has changed, but it was a nice way to get back into coding. I realized many of the things I wanted to achieve I was unable to do, so I will have to ask for help on these things, one particular case: how to get the animals to change positions once everytime the background changes colors rather than looping for eternity.

It is a challenging game, because of the constant shuffle, the player can see the left leaning animal but not have time to click it!!!
