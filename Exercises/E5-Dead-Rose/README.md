# Template p5 project

This is inspired by Pippin's Haiku generator, but going for a different vibe.
This is a gothic poem generator.
There are three images to elect to click: a squid, a stained glass, and a tomb
Each image display a different poem that is a madlib of Dead Rose
With different madlib entries series for each of the 3 images
