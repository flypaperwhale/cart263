# Monkey Business based on Fire Walk with Me

This project is an artistic rendition of Twin Peaks Fire Walk with Me
It is my attempt at deciphering David Lynch's dream
And making a dream of my own

We follow Laura in her psychedelic-psychic trip where the dark entity BOB
is trying to get at her.

The program uses a json dataset to block different cues and follow a the script,
displaying the dialog in sequence, and activating sounds and images

the user is also made to view the game from Laura's perspective
they are called through the use of annyang to engage with Laura's reality

Pay attention to messages and warnings.
